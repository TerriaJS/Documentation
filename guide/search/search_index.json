            "text": "The easiest way to get started with TerriaJS is to use \nTerriaMap\n.  TerriaMap is a full-featured application built on TerriaJS, ready to be customized with your own branding and catalog.  It is also a great starting point for more in-depth customization.\n\n\nThis guide explains how to build and run TerriaMap locally.  See \nDeploying\n to learn how to deploy it for use by others.\n\n\nYou may also be interested in how to \nmake your own map without writing any code\n.\n\n\nQuick Start\n\n\nIf you've done this sort of thing before, you'll find it easy to clone and build TerriaMap with these quick instructions:\n\n\ngit clone https://github.com/TerriaJS/TerriaMap.git\n\ncd TerriaMap\n\nnpm install \n npm run gulp \n npm start\n\n# Open at http://localhost:3001\n\n\n\n\nIf you run into trouble or want more explanation, read on.\n\n\nPrerequisites\n\n\nTerriaJS can be built and run on almost any macOS, Linux, or Windows system.  The following are required to build TerriaJS:\n\n\n\n\nThe Bash command shell. On macOS or Linux you almost certainly already have this. On Windows, you can easily get it by installing \nGit for Windows\n. In the instructions below, we assume you're using a Bash command prompt.\n\n\nNode.js\n v8.0 or later.  v10.x is also known to work.  You can check your node version by running \nnode --version\n on the command-line.\n\n\nnpm\n v6.0 or later.  npm is usually installed automatically alongside the above.  You can check your npm version by running \nnpm --version\n.\n\n\n\n\nThe following components are optional:\n\n\n\n\nGDAL\n - Used for the conversion service that transforms Esri Shapefiles and other more obscure formats into GeoJSON for display in TerriaJS.  This is \nnot\n required for formats that TerriaJS supports directly, including KML, GeoJSON, etc.\n\n\n\n\nCloning TerriaMap\n\n\nThe latest version of TerriaMap is on \nGitHub\n, and the preferred way to get it is by using \ngit\n:\n\n\ngit clone https://github.com/TerriaJS/TerriaMap.git\n\ncd TerriaMap\n\n\n\n\nIf you're unable to use git, you can also \ndownload a ZIP file\n and extract it somewhere on your system.  We recommend using git, though, because it makes it much easier to update to later versions in the future.\n\n\nInstalling Dependencies\n\n\nAll of the dependencies required to build and run TerriaMap, other than the prerequisites listed above, are installed using \nnpm\n:\n\n\nnpm install\n\n\n\n\nThe dependencies are installed in the \nnode_modules\n subdirectory.  No global changes are made to your system.\n\n\nBuilding TerriaMap\n\n\nDo a standard build of TerriaMap with:\n\n\nnpm run gulp\n\n\n\n\nOr, you can create a minified release build with:\n\n\nnpm run gulp release\n\n\n\n\nTo watch for changes and automatically do an incremental build when any are detected, use:\n\n\nnpm run gulp watch\n\n\n\n\nnpm run gulp\n simply runs \ngulp\n, so you can use that directly if you prefer (run \nnpm install -g gulp\n to install it globally).\n\n\nThe full set of \ngulp\n tasks can be found on the \nDevelopment Environment\n page.\n\n\nRunning TerriaMap\n\n\nTerriaMap includes a simple Node.js-based web server, called \nterriajs-server\n.  To start it, run:\n\n\nnpm start\n\n\n\n\nThen, open a web browser on \nhttp://localhost:3001\n to use TerriaMap.\n\n\nKeeping up with Updates\n\n\nIf you're building an application by using TerriaMap as a starting point, you will want to keep in sync as TerriaMap is improved and updated to use new versions of TerriaJS.  Forking the TerriaMap repo and using git to keep it in sync is outside the scope of this document, but GitHub has a \nnice explanation\n.\n\n\nAfter pulling new changes, you will need to run \nnpm install\n again to pick up any changed dependencies and then build TerriaMap.  If you have problems building or running, it is sometimes helpful to remove and reinstall the dependencies from npm:\n\n\nrm -rf node_modules\nnpm install\n\n\n\n\nPrettier\n\n\nPrettier\n is used to format this codebase.\n\n\nIf you've forked TerriaMap prior to prettier being applied, merging will be a hassle. Here's how to do it (relatively) painlessly:\n\n\n\n\nCreate a new branch for your merge: \ngit checkout -b whatever-merge\n\n\nIf you haven't already installed \nnpm-merge-driver\n, add it to your local git config via \nnpx npm-merge-driver install\n.\n\n\nMerge the last commit before prettier into your branch: \ngit merge pre-prettier\n. Resolve any conflicts as usual. If utilising yarn, it will resolve any \nyarn-lock.json\n conflicts automatically with another \nyarn install\n\n\nCommit the merge above.\n\n\nMerge the commit that ran prettier on all the source files into your branch. This is likely to cause heaps of conflicts, but because you've already merged the last commit before prettier, and because the prettier commit only changes formatting, you can safely accept your version any time there is a conflict. \ngit merge post-prettier --strategy=ours --no-commit\n\n\nRun prettier on the result of the merge before committing it: \nnpm run prettier\n\n\nCommit the merged result.\n\n\nMerge master into your branch in order to pick up any changes in master that happened after the prettiergeddon: \ngit merge origin/master\n. Resolve any conflicts as normal.\n\n\nCommit and push your branch.\n\n\nOpen a pull request of your merge branch into the original one. It should merge cleanly.\n\n\n\n\nIf you're merging a branch-that-has-already-followed-this-procedure into your branch, you can follow the procedure above except that you need to use different commits instead of \npre-prettier\n and \npost-prettier\n. Look at the commits in the source branch and you should see two that look like this:\n\n\n\n\nUse the commit hash of the commit that merged \npre-prettier\n in place of \npre-prettier\n above. Use the commit hash of the commit that merged \npost-prettier\n in place of \npost-prettier\n above.\n\n\nHaving trouble? Drop by the TerriaJS \ngitter\n or \nforum\n and we'll be happy to help!\n\n\nNext Steps\n\n\nNow that you have a working local build of TerriaMap, you may want to \ncustomize it\n or \ndeploy it\n for others to use.",

In a default TerriaMap installation, the main init file is found in \nwwwroot/init/terria.json\n.\n\n\nAn init file is a \nJSON file\n with this basic structure:\n\n\n{\n    \ncatalog\n: [\n        {\n            \ntype\n: \ngroup\n,\n            \nname\n: \nMy group\n,\n            \nitems\n: [\n            ...\n            ]\n        },\n        ...\n    ],\n    \nhomeCamera\n: {\n        \nnorth\n: -8,\n        \neast\n: 158,\n        \nsouth\n: -45,\n        \nwest\n: 109\n    },\n    \ninitialCamera\n: { ... },\n    \ncorsDomains\n: [ \nmyserver.gov.au\n ]\n}\n\n\n\n\nKey points:\n\n\n\n\ncatalog\n is an array.\n\n\nEvery element of that array must have a \ntype\n (corresponding to a value recognised by TerriaJS) and a \nname\n.\n\n\nThe three major categories of catalog member types are:\n\n\nCatalog Group\n: A group (folder) of items.  Different group types allow the contents to be manually specified or to be automatically determined by querying various types of server.\n\n\nCatalog Item\n: Actual geospatial or chart data from a file or service, in various formats.\n\n\nCatalog Function\n: A parameterized service, such as a Web Processing Service (WPS).  The user supplies the parameters and gets back some result.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost of the other properties of each layer depend on the specific type.  See the links above for details of each type.\n\n\nUsing a catalog file\n\n\nThere are four ways to load a catalog file into a TerriaJS application:\n\n\n\n\nStore it in Terria Map's \nwwwroot/init\n directory, and refer to it in the \ninitializationUrls\n section of the \nconfig.json\n file. It is loaded automatically when you visit the webpage.  This is how \nwwwroot/init/terria.json\n is loaded in the default TerriaMap setup.\n\n\nStore it in Terria Maps's \nwwwroot/init\n directory, without adding it to config.json. Add the catalog file name (without \n.json\n) to the URL after \n#\n. For instance, \nexample.com/terria#mycatalog\n. See \nControlling with URL Parameters\n for more information. This method is useful when developing a catalog that is not quite ready for public access, but it is helpful to show it to interested stakeholders.\n\n\nStore it anywhere on the web (on a \nCORS-enabled\n server). Add the complete URL (including \n.json\n) to the URL, after \n#\n. For instance, \nhttp://nationalmap.gov.au/#http://example.com/mycatalog.json\n. This method is useful when developing services for a TerriaJS instance which you don't directly control, and for rapidly previewing changes which you can also share with people.\n\n\nStore it locally, then drag and drop it into the Terria Map window.\n\n\n\n\nAll catalog files, however loaded, are merged together in TerriaJS. Any two items with the same name and place in the tree are combined. This means that if two catalog files each define a group called \"Water\", there will be only one \"Water\" group in Terria, containing the two sets of group members merged together.\n\n\nEditing catalog files\n\n\nCatalog files can be edited three ways:\n\n\n\n\nUsing a desktop text editor. Be very careful to ensure that your file is valid JSON. This is more restrictive format than simple JavaScript, for instance. You can use \nhttp://jsonlint.com/\n.\n\n\nUsing a JSON-specific editor, such as \nhttp://www.jsoneditoronline.org/\n. This has the advantage that your file will be valid JSON.\n\n\nUsing the TerriaJS Catalog Editor, currently available in a preview version at \nhttp://terria.io/DataSourceEditor/\n. This editor is not yet considered reliable, and may cause data corruption.\n\n\n\n\nCatalog file properties\n\n\ncorsDomains\n\n\nBy default, TerriaJS proxies all requests within the proxy whitelist specified in the \nServer-side Config\n, making the assumption that the servers do not support CORS. You can add hosts that are known to support CORS to this property to avoid proxying them.\n\n\n\"corsDomains\": [ \"myserver.gov.au\" ]\n\n\nSee \nCross-Origin Resource Sharing\n for more information.\n\n\nhomeCamera\n and \ninitialCamera\n\n\nMaps have two camera positions, \nhomeCamera\n and \ninitialCamera\n. They are specified identically. All the examples here use \nhomeCamera\n, but apply equally to both.\n\n\n\n\ninitialCamera\n: the location when the map first displays\n\n\nhomeCamera\n: where the camera goes when you click the \"home\" button between the zoom-in and zoom-out buttons.\n\n\n\n\nOption 1: \nnorth\n, \nsouth\n, \neast\n, \nwest\n\n\nThe bounding box method uses \nnorth\n, \neast\n,\nsouth\n, and \nwest\n, in lat/lng decimal degrees.  The camera will be positioned in the center point of those bounds, looking toward the Earth's center, zoomed back enough to see to the edges of the bounds.\n\n\nThis is the only mode supported in 2D mode (Leaflet). Therefore, you should always include a bounding box, even if you also use another mode.\n\n\nhomeCamera\n: {\n    \nnorth\n: -8,\n    \neast\n: 158,\n    \nsouth\n: -45,\n    \nwest\n: 109\n}\n\n\n\n\nOption 2: \nposition\n, \ndirection\n and \nup\n\n\nThis overrides Option 1.\n\n\nYou can specify \nposition\n, \ndirection\n, and \nup\n (as well as\n\nnorth\n, \neast\n,\nsouth\n, and \nwest\n). \nposition\n, \ndirection\n and \nup\n\nneed \nx\n, \ny\n and \nz\n keys specifying locations in\n\nECEF\n metre coordinates, which\nmeans the origin is the centre of the Earth, positive Z points to\nthe north pole, positive X points toward\n\n\"Null Island\"\n where the\nequator intersects with 0 degrees longitude, and positive Y points at\n(0, 90E) -- which is in the Indian Ocean south of the Bay of Bengal.\n\n\n\n\nposition\n: where the camera is\n\n\ndirection\n: where the camera is looking\n\n\nup\n: which way is \"up\", which determines how the camera is rotated\n\n\n\n\nFor most purposes positioning this way is difficult for normal\nhumans. To see an example, move the camera to some location, click the \"share\" button (and choose to not use the\nURL shortner), then URL-decode the URL you get.\n\n\nhomeCamera\n: {\n    \nwest\n: 105.51019777628066,\n    \nsouth\n: -39.61110094535454,\n    \neast\n: 161.48980219597954,\n    \nnorth\n: -9.09249015267353,\n    \nposition\n: {\n        \nx\n: -6685409.955422118,\n        \ny\n: 7044952.140379313,\n        \nz\n: -4828130.30167422\n    },\n    \ndirection\n: {\n        \nx\n: 0.6155666547559182,\n        \ny\n: -0.6486719065674744,\n        \nz\n: 0.4475516184561574\n    },\n    \nup\n: {\n        \nx\n: -0.30807420442344124,\n        \ny\n: 0.3246424737331665,\n        \nz\n: 0.8942580996654569\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nOption 3: \npositionHeading\n (like an aircraft)\n\n\nSetting \npositionHeading\n is useful for when you're showing a view from an aircraft or\nsatellite, and overrides Options 1 and 2.\n\n\nIt has the following attributes:\n\n\n\n\ncameraLongitude\n: longitude of camera\n\n\ncameraLatitude\n: latitude of camera\n\n\ncameraHeight\n: height of camera above earth's surface, probably in metres\n\n\nheading\n: in degrees clockwise from north (90 is east)\n\n\npitch\n: how much the camera is tilted, in degrees down from horizontal (-90 is straight down)\n\n\nroll\n: how much the camera is rotated left or right, in degrees\n\n\n\n\nhomeCamera\n: {\n    \npositionHeading\n: {\n        \ncameraLongitude\n: 145,\n        \ncameraLatitude\n: -37,\n        \ncameraHeight\n: 1000,\n        \nheading\n: 0,\n        \npitch\n: -70,\n        \nroll\n: 0,\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nOption 4: \nlookAt\n (a feature)\n\n\nlookAt\n is probably the most useful one for showing a feature on the\nmap, and overrides Options 1, 2, and 3.\n\n\nIt has these attributes:\n\n\n\n\ntargetLongitude\n: The longitude to look at\n\n\ntargetLatitude\n: The latitude to look at\n\n\ntargetHeight\n: in meters above the WGS84 ellipsoid (positive is up)\n\n\nheading\n: in degrees clockwise from north\n\n\npitch\n: in degrees down from horizontal (so negative values mean you're looking at the sky)\n\n\nrange\n: in meters from the thing you're looking at\n\n\n\n\nhomeCamera\n: {\n    \nlookAt\n: {\n        \ntargetLongitude\n: 145,\n        \ntargetLatitude\n: 37,\n        \ntargetHeight\n: 0,\n        \nheading\n: 0,\n        \npitch\n: -90,\n        \nrange\n: 1000,\n    }\n}",

            "text": "This section explains how to get your own catalogs and data into a TerriaJS application.\n\n\nBefore beginning, it is very important to understand \nCross-Origin Resource Sharing\n.  Web browsers impose restrictions on how we're allowed to access data across hosts (e.g. accessing data on \ndata.gov.au\n from a web site running at \nnationalmap.gov.au\n).  Understanding these issues will avoid a lot of frustration while trying to add your data to a TerriaJS application.\n\n\nTerriaJS can interface with three broad types if data:\n\n\n\n\nCatalog Group\n: A group (folder) of items.  Different group types allow the contents to be manually specified or to be automatically determined by querying various types of server.  TerriaJS can use many different types of servers to populate a group, including CKAN, CSW, WMS, and more.  For example, if you define a catalog group that points at a Web Map Service (WMS) server, TerriaJS will query the WMS \nGetCapabilities\n when the group is opened and fill the group with all of the layers advertised by the WMS server.\n\n\nCatalog Item\n: Actual geospatial or chart data from a file or service, in various formats.  TerriaJS supports WMS, KML, GeoJSON, ArcGIS MapServer, and many more files and services as catalog items.\n\n\nCatalog Function\n: A parameterized service, such as a Web Processing Service (WPS).  The user supplies the parameters and gets back some result.",

            "text": "To ensure that TerriaJS is able to access your data, you must add all servers you intend to access to \ndevserverconfig.json\n's \nallowProxyFor\n list. This \"whitelist\" authorizes the proxy to work with those servers.\n\n\nFailing to do this may result in an error like this:\n\n\n...the server does not support CORS. If this is your server, verify that CORS is enabled and enable it if it is not. If you do not control the server, please contact the administrator of the server and ask them to enable CORS. Or ... ask us to add this server to the list of non-CORS-supporting servers that may be proxied.\n\n\nNext, you should add servers that \ndo\n support Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) to the \ncorsDomains\n list in your \ninitialization file\n. Servers in this list are contacted directly instead of going through the proxy... except:\n\n\n\n\nin Internet Explorer 9\n\n\nif an HTTPS web page is accessing an HTTP server (this way we avoid a mixed content warning from the browser).\n\n\n\n\nIf your server does \nnot\n support CORS, then you still need to add it to the \nallowProxyFor\n whitelist, but do not add it to the \ncorsDomains\n list. It will then be proxied.\n\n\nSometimes we deliberately exclude CORS-supporting servers from the \ncorsDomains\n list; the proxy caches its data, so we leverage its caching to improve performance.\n\n\nIn both lists, a server name \nfoo.org\n will be interpreted as \n*.foo.org\n. The port must match exactly. It's not very smart, so if you specify port 80 that won't match a server without a port specified, and vice-versa.\n\n\nThe downside to a permissive whitelist is that you'll proxy for more servers, and people could use your proxy to make their (malicious?) traffic look like it's coming from your server instead of from theirs.\n\n\nMore Detailed Explanation\n\n\nAs a general rule, web browsers do not allow web sites running on one host (e.g. \nnationalmap.gov.au\n) from accessing data running on another host (e.g. \ndata.gov.au\n) unless the data server (\ndata.gov.au\n in our example) explicitly enables a feature called Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) by including a special HTTP header in its response.  Unfortunately, many servers still do not support CORS.  If you control the server you're trying to access data on, enabling CORS is almost certainly a good idea, and you can read more about how to do it at \nenable-cors.org\n.\n\n\nTerriaJS has a trick to allow it to access data from a server even if that server doesn't support CORS: it uses a proxy server built into \nterriajs-server\n, which is included with TerriaMap.  The idea is simple: we avoid the need for cross-origin support from servers by running a proxy on the same host that runs our app.  That proxy can make requests to \nother\n servers on our application's behalf.  This works because cross-origin restrictions are a security feature of web browsers, not web servers.  The proxy makes it look to the browser like the data comes from the same origin.  There's nothing dodgy about this.  The risks that browsers are defending against by imposing cross-origin restrictions are not present in this scenario.\n\n\nHowever, by running a proxy server, our TerriaMap server potentially opens itself up to risks.  We don't want people to be able to bounce arbitrary requests through our proxy, because that could be used to make (malicious?) traffic look like it is coming from your server instead of from the real source.  This is why \nterriajs-server\n uses a whitelist of servers that it is willing to proxy for.  The \nallowProxyFor\n property in \ndevserverconfig.json\n specifies the whitelist.  If the server is asked to proxy for any server not in the whitelist, the request will be rejected.",

In fact the json\nis exactly the same as the initialization file, and can be included there too.\n\n\nLet's start with an example. Save this snippet as \nexample.json\n and drag it onto the map.\n\n\n{\n    \ncatalog\n: [\n        {\n            \nname\n: \nVictorian postcodes\n,\n            \ntype\n: \ncsv\n,\n            \nurl\n: \nhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/TerriaJS/terriajs/5.2.4/wwwroot/test/csv/3000s.csv\n,\n            \ntableStyle\n: {\n                \ncolorMap\n: \ngreen-orange\n\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\n\n\n\nAt first it will appear like nothing has happened. This is because json files instruct Terria to update the catalog, not directly add data onto the map.\nSo head back to the Data Catalog, and scroll to the bottom. You will see a new item called\n\"Victorian postcodes\". Add this to the map.\n\n\nTwo things will happen. First, you will get a message telling you that many of the values\nare not actually valid Australian postcodes. We'll fix that in a moment. Second, you will\nsee a swathe of yellow-green color across Victoria. Without the json, the csv file would\nhave appeared using the default shades of red.\n\n\nTo remove the invalid region name warning, just add this to the json (at the same level as \"name\" and \"type\"):\n\n\n            \nshowWarnings\n: false,\n\n\n\n\nThis same option can be used with any tabular data type, eg.

You can gain control of these settings by writing a small json file. In fact the json\nis exactly the same as the initialization file, and can be included there too.  Let's start with an example. Save this snippet as  example.json  and drag it onto the map.  {\n     catalog : [\n        {\n             name :  Victorian postcodes ,\n             type :  csv ,\n             url :  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TerriaJS/terriajs/5.2.4/wwwroot/test/csv/3000s.csv ,\n             tableStyle : {\n                 colorMap :  green-orange \n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}  At first it will appear like nothing has happened. This is because json files instruct Terria to update the catalog, not directly add data onto the map.\nSo head back to the Data Catalog, and scroll to the bottom. You will see a new item called\n\"Victorian postcodes\". Add this to the map.  Two things will happen. First, you will get a message telling you that many of the values\nare not actually valid Australian postcodes. We'll fix that in a moment. Second, you will\nsee a swathe of yellow-green color across Victoria. Without the json, the csv file would\nhave appeared using the default shades of red.  To remove the invalid region name warning, just add this to the json (at the same level as \"name\" and \"type\"):               showWarnings : false,  This same option can be used with any tabular data type, eg. Sensor Observation Service and SDMX-JSON items as well.

Here we are using \n\"number\"\n formatting which is also the default formatting if \n\"type\"\n is not supplied.\n\n\nThe supported format options are:\n\n\n\n\n\"maximumFractionDigits\": X\n: To reduce the number of decimal places to a maximum of X digits.\n\n\n\"minimumFractionDigits\": X\n: To increase the number of decimal places to a minimum of X digits.\n\n\n\"useGrouping\": true\n: To show thousands separators.\n\n\n\"style\": \"percent\"\n: To show 0.15 as 15%.\n\n\n\n\nA second method is to use \nterria.formatNumber\n directly in the template. This accepts an initial JSON string describing the same options as above. To simplify the notation, the quotes around the keys are optional here.\n\n\n          \"featureInfoTemplate\": \"template\": \"Pixel colour: \nb\nRed={{#terria.formatNumber}}{maximumFractionDigits:3}{{Red}}{{/terria.formatNumber}}\n/b\n.\"\n\n\n\nURL-encoding strings\n\n\nTo URL-encode a value in a template, use \nterria.urlEncode\n or \nterria.urlEncodeComponent\n.  For example:\n\n\nTest: {{#terria.urlEncode}}http://example.com/a b{{/terria.urlEncode}}\nTest: {{#terria.urlEncodeComponent}}W/HOE#1{{/terria.urlEncodeComponent}}\n\n\n\nFormatting dates\n\n\nSimilar to formatting numbers you can format dates in the \n\"formats\"\n section by suppliying \n\"dateTime\"\n in the \n\"type\"\n property, eg:\n\n\n          \"featureInfoTemplate\": {\n            \"template\": \"Date: {{Date}}\",\n            \"formats\": {\n              \"Date\": {\n                \"type\": \"dateTime\";\n                \"format\": \"dd-mm-yyyy HH:MM:ss\";\n              }\n            }\n          }\n\n\n\nThe date format style used for the \n\"format\"\n property is the style from the \nnpm dateformat package\n, e.g. \n\"dd-mm-yyyy HH:MM:ss\"\n or \n\"isoDateTime\"\n.\n\n\nAs with number you can also use \nterria.dateTimeformat\n directly in the template. This accepts an initial JSON string describing the same options as above.\n\n\n          \"featureInfoTemplate\": \"template\": \"{{#terria.formatDateTime}}{format: \\\"dd-mm-yyyy HH:MM:ss\\\"}2017-11-23T08:47:53Z{{/terria.formatDateTime}}\n/b\n.\"\n\n\n\nTime-series charts\n\n\nFor features with time-varying table-based data structures (eg. CSV, SOS2, SDMX-JSON, if there is a time column), the feature info panel also includes a chart of the data over time, eg.\n\n\n\n\nYou can place this chart in your template using \n{{terria.timeSeries.chart}}\n.  Alternatively, you can access the following component information:\n\n\n\n\n{{terria.timeSeries.xName}}\n - the x-column name\n\n\n{{terria.timeSeries.yName}}\n - the y-column name\n\n\n{{terria.timeSeries.title}}\n\n\n{{terria.timeSeries.id}}\n\n\n{{terria.timeSeries.units}}\n - the column units as a comma-separated string.\n\n\n{{terria.timeSeries.data}}\n - the data as a comma-separated string.\n\n\n\n\nPlease note:\n\n If any of the component information above contains double-quotes, double quotes will be removed before TerriaJS processes the template further.\n\n If any of the component information above is used as part of tag attributes, it must be surrounded by double-quotes. e.g. \nchart y-column=\"{{terria.timeSeries.yName}}\"\n/chart\n\n\nSo you could reconstruct the chart manually as:\n\n\nh4\n{{terria.timeSeries.title}}\n/h4\n\n\nchart x-column=\n{{terria.timeSeries.xName}}\n\n       y-column=\n{{terria.timeSeries.yName}}\n\n       id=\n{{terria.timeSeries.id}}\n\n       column-units=\n{{terria.timeSeries.units}}\n\n    {{terria.timeSeries.data}}\n\n/chart\n\n\n\n\n\nor use this as a basis to customise the chart.\n\n\nOther supporting data\n\n\nThe clicked point's latitude and longitude are also available as \n{{terria.coords.latitude}}\n and \n{{terria.coords.longitude}}\n.\n\n\nThe current time for the layer is avaliable as \n{{terria.currentTime}}\n.\n\n\nMore examples\n\n\nSome examples are here: \nhttps://github.com/TerriaJS/terriajs/blob/master/wwwroot/test/init/csv.json\n, and \ncharts.json\n.\n\n\nYou can add this directly to your catalog by appending \n#build/TerriaJS/test/init/csv.json\n to the URL to your map, eg. \nhttp://localhost:3001/#build/TerriaJS/test/init/csv.json\n.",

If false, 403s are assumed to just be missing tiles and need not be\nreported to the user.  treat404AsError  A value indicating whether a 404 response code when requesting a tile should be\ntreated as an error.  If false, 404s are assumed to just be missing tiles and need not be\nreported to the user.  url  The URL of this data.  useOwnClock  A flag indicating whether imagery should be displayed using this item's own clock (currentTime, multiplier),\nor, if false, the terria clock (whose current time is shown in the timeline UI). Default false.  zoomOnEnable  A value indicating whether the map will automatically zoom to this catalog item when it is enabled.  Note that within a single init source:   Catalog items with both  isEnabled  and  zoomOnEnable  set to true will override the top-level  initialCamera  property.  If multiple catalog items have both  isEnabled  and  zoomOnEnable  set to true, it is undefined which one will affect the camera.   In the case of multiple init sources, however, the camera will reflect whatever happens in the  last  init source, whether\nit is a result of a  zoomOnEnable  or an  initialCamera ,",

If there is more than one\nlegend URL, this property returns the first one.  legendUrls  The URLs of the legends to show when this catalog item is enabled.  linkedWcsCoverage  The coverage name for linked WCS for clip-and-ship. This proerty is part\nof an experimental feature and may be subject to change.  linkedWcsUrl  The URL of a WCS that enables clip-and-ship for this WMS item. This\nproerty is part of an experimental feature and may be subject to change.  maxRefreshIntervals  The maximum number of intervals that can be created by a single\ndate range, when specified in the form time/time/periodicity.\neg. 2015-04-27T16:15:00/2015-04-27T18:45:00/PT15M has 11 intervals  maximumShownFeatureInfos  The maximum number of features whose information can be shown at one time in the Feature Info Panel, from this item.\nDefaults to terria.configParameters.defaultMaximumShownFeatureInfos  metadataUrl  The URL from which this data item's metadata description can be retrieved, or undefined if\nmetadata is not available for this data item.  The format of the metadata depends on the type of data item.\nFor example, Web Map Service (WMS) data items provide their metadata via their GetCapabilities document.  minScaleDenominator  The denominator of the largest scale (smallest denominator) for which tiles should be requested.  For example, if this value is 1000, then tiles representing\na scale larger than 1:1000 (i.e. numerically smaller denominator, when zooming in closer) will not be requested.  Instead, tiles of the largest-available scale, as specified by this property,\nwill be used and will simply get blurier as the user zooms in closer.  name  The name of the item.  nameInCatalog  The name of this catalog member in the catalog. By default this is just  name , but can be overridden.  nowViewingIndex  The index of the item in the Now Viewing list.  Setting this property does not automatically change the order.\nThis property is used intenally to save/restore the Now Viewing order and is not intended for general use.  nowViewingMessage  A message to show when this item is enabled for the first time in order to call attention to the Now Viewing panel.  opacity  The opacity (alpha) of the data item, where 0.0 is fully transparent and 1.0 is\nfully opaque.  parameters  The additional parameters to pass to the WMS server when requesting images.\nAll parameter names must be entered in lowercase in order to be consistent with references in TerrisJS code.\nIf this property is undefined, WebMapServiceCatalogItem.defaultParameters is used.  populateIntervalsFromTimeDimension  A value indicating whether a time dimension, if it exists in GetCapabilities, should be used to populate\nthe ImageryLayerCatalogItem's intervals.  If the ImageryLayerCatalogItem's intervals property is set explicitly\non this catalog item, the value of this property is ignored.  rectangle  The geographic rectangle (extent or bounding box) containing this data item.  shortReport  A short report to show on the now viewing tab.  showOnChart  Whether to show imagery availability on charts.  showsInfo  A value indicating whether this data source should show an info icon.  styles  The comma-separated list of styles to request, one per layer list in WebMapServiceCatalogItem's layers.  supportsColorScaleRange  Gets or sets whether this WMS server has been identified as supporting the COLORSCALERANGE parameter.  tileErrorThresholdBeforeDisabling  Allow a threshold to be configured for the number of tile fails\nbefore disabling the layer.  tilingScheme  The tiling scheme to pass to the WMS server when requesting images.\nIf this property is undefiend, the default tiling scheme of the provider is used.  tokenParameterName  The name of the URL query parameter used to provide the token\nto the server. This property is ignored if WebMapServiceCatalogItem's tokenUrl is undefined.  tokenUrl  The URL to use for requesting tokens. Typically, this is set to  /esri-token-auth  to use\nthe ArcGIS token mechanism built into terriajs-server.  treat403AsError  A value indicating whether a 403 response code when requesting a tile should be\ntreated as an error.  If false, 403s are assumed to just be missing tiles and need not be\nreported to the user.  treat404AsError  A value indicating whether a 404 response code when requesting a tile should be\ntreated as an error.  If false, 404s are assumed to just be missing tiles and need not be\nreported to the user.  url  The URL of this data.  useOwnClock  A flag indicating whether imagery should be displayed using this item's own clock (currentTime, multiplier),\nor, if false, the terria clock (whose current time is shown in the timeline UI). Default false.  zoomOnEnable  A value indicating whether the map will automatically zoom to this catalog item when it is enabled.  Note that within a single init source:   Catalog items with both  isEnabled  and  zoomOnEnable  set to true will override the top-level  initialCamera  property.  If multiple catalog items have both  isEnabled  and  zoomOnEnable  set to true, it is undefined which one will affect the camera.   In the case of multiple init sources, however, the camera will reflect whatever happens in the  last  init source, whether\nit is a result of a  zoomOnEnable  or an  initialCamera ,",

For example to create a geoserver called my_new_geoserver use the commands below.\n\n\nsudo cp geoserver.war /var/lib/tomcat8/webapps/my_new_geoserver.war\nsudo /etc/init.d/tomcat8 restart\n\n\n\n\nYou should now be able to see a geoserver running at http://localhost:8080/my_new_geoserver/ .  \n\n\nThe geoserver will contain the example datasets that ship with Geoserver.  Geoserver has good documentation available \nhere\n to get you going on entering your data into your server instance.\n\n\nCaching Tiles\n\n\nIn order for your server to perform effectively we highly recommend that you cache the tile requests from National Map.  There are 2 primary ways to do this - either turning on the GeoWebCache that comes with Geoserver or running a proxy server in front of your geoserver.\n\n\nThe easiest solution is to just use the GeoWebCache service.  The documentation for GeoWebCache is \nhere\n.  Mainly it consists of turning on direct integration in the caching defaults and making sure that your layers have caching turned on.  You may also want to control the caching folder which can be done by editing your geoserver instance as explained \nhere\n.  You will also probably need to set permissions in your new cache folder to 666.\n\n\nThe other solution is to put a caching proxy in front of your geoserver instance.  This also has the benefit of being able to access your server on port 80 if you wish.  The two primary options we have worked with are \nnginx\n and \nvarnish\n.  These are both available as packages on ubuntu.  Below is an example of setting up nginx to work with geoserver.\n\n\nnginx\n\n\nsudo apt-get install -y nginx\n\n\n\n\nThen modify the configuration files to point to your server and turn on caching\n\n\nsudo /etc/init.d/nginx stop\nsudo cp /etc/nginx/nginx.conf /etc/nginx/nginx.conf.orig\nsudo nano /etc/nginx/nginx.conf\n\n\n\n\nand add this line at the bottom of the http section\n\n\nproxy_cache_path /your/cache/folder/ keys_zone=one:10m max_size=8G;\n\n\n\n\nsudo cp /etc/nginx/sites-available/default /etc/nginx/sites-available/default.orig\nsudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/default\n\n\n\n\nin the servers section, comment out the root and index lines and add this line right after\n\n\nproxy_cache one;\n\n\n\n\nand replace the location setting in the server section with the following code (replacing my_new_geoserver with your server name)\n\n\n    location /my_new_geoserver/ {\n        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8080/;\n        proxy_next_upstream error timeout invalid_header http_500 http_502 http_503 http_504;\n            proxy_redirect off;\n            proxy_buffering off;\n            proxy_set_header        Host            $http_host;\n            proxy_set_header        X-Real-IP       $remote_addr;\n            proxy_set_header        X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;\n    }\n\n\n\n\nNow restart\n\n\nsudo /etc/init.d/nginx start\n\n\n\n\nAnd if all went as planned you should be able to access your server at http://localhost/my_new_geoserver/web.\n\n\nAllowing National Map to access your server\n\n\nDue to security in modern browsers, for National Map to use your service you will probably need to do a little more work.  Either you will need to set up your server with CORS support or provide a proxy service for your geoserver to allow National Map access to your data.  National Map includes a proxy to some domains by default and if you are in these domains we will provide the proxy service.\n\n\nIf you are not in these domains, you will get an cross-domain-access error. To work with National Map without using a proxy, Geoserver must be configured to support \nCORS\n.  The most common way to do this is to install \nCORS Filter\n.\n\n\nAn alternative approach, is to add CORS support to your nginx or varnish proxy service.  See the documentation on how to do this.  Thanks to the AREMI team, adding the necessary CORS headers with a Varnish reverse-proxy in front of the Geoserver can be done by adding the following to \n/etc/varnish/default.vcl\n:\n\n\nsub vcl_fetch {\n    set beresp.http.Access-Control-Allow-Origin = \n*\n;\n    set beresp.http.Access-Control-Allow-Credentials = \ntrue\n;\n}\n\n\n\n\nMoving your Geoserver Instance\n\n\nMoving your geoserver instance to a new location is pretty straightforward.  The .war file that a geoserver instance comes in is just a special layout of a .zip file.  So the following commands can be used to create a .war file that you can then add to a tomcat instance on another server.\n\n\nsudo /etc/init.d/tomcat8 stop\nsudo mv /var/lib/tomcat8/webapps/my_new_geoserver .\ncd my_new_geoserver\nzip -r my_new_geoserver.war *\nsudo mv my_new_geoserver /var/lib/tomcat8/webapps\nsudo /etc/init.d/tomcat8 start\n\n\n\n\nonce it's uploaded to the new site you can add the geoserver with:\n\n\nsudo cp my_new_geoserver.war /var/lib/tomcat8/webapps/my_new_geoserver.war\nsudo /etc/init.d/tomcat8 restart\n\n\n\n\nRunning your Geoserver on AWS\n\n\nRunning a geoserver on a standard EC2 instance requires a little tuning to take advantage of the instance storage volume properly.  First go ahead and create your instance (we use a standard m3.large instance with port 80 opened) and install java and tomcat as explained above.\n\n\nNow package up your geoserver as described in the previous section and copy it up to your EC2 instance and ssh in once it's copied.\n\n\nscp -i geoserver-instance.pem my_new_geoserver.war ubuntu@xx.xx.xx.xx:/home/ubuntu\nssh -i geoserver-instance.pem ubuntu@xx.xx.xx.xx\n\n\n\n\nFrom the shell the first thing you need to do is move the webapps folder in tomcat to the instance storage.\n\n\nsudo /etc/init.d/tomcat8 stop\nsudo cp -rf /var/lib/tomcat8/webapps /var/lib/tomcat8/webapps.orig\nsudo mv /var/lib/tomcat8/webapps/ /mnt\nsudo ln -s /mnt/webapps /var/lib/tomcat8/webapps\n\n\n\n\nand copy your uploaded geoserver\n\n\nsudo cp *.war /mnt/webapps\n\n\n\n\nand then restart\n\n\nsudo /etc/init.d/tomcat8 start\nsudo /etc/init.d/nginx restart\n\n\n\n\nIf you are using geowebcache or a caching proxy you will need to change the caching dir as referenced above to also be on the /mnt drive to avoid running out of space on the EC2 boot drive.\n\n\nNOTE: If the instance is stopped you will need to go through these step again when you start, since the instance storage is wiped clean in this case.  This does not apply to reboot of the OS in the EC2 instance so it will still be fine after.",

Either you will need to set up your server with CORS support or provide a proxy service for your geoserver to allow National Map access to your data.  National Map includes a proxy to some domains by default and if you are in these domains we will provide the proxy service.  If you are not in these domains, you will get an cross-domain-access error. To work with National Map without using a proxy, Geoserver must be configured to support  CORS .  The most common way to do this is to install  CORS Filter .  An alternative approach, is to add CORS support to your nginx or varnish proxy service.  See the documentation on how to do this.  Thanks to the AREMI team, adding the necessary CORS headers with a Varnish reverse-proxy in front of the Geoserver can be done by adding the following to  /etc/varnish/default.vcl :  sub vcl_fetch {\n    set beresp.http.Access-Control-Allow-Origin =  * ;\n    set beresp.http.Access-Control-Allow-Credentials =  true ;\n}",

First go ahead and create your instance (we use a standard m3.large instance with port 80 opened) and install java and tomcat as explained above.  Now package up your geoserver as described in the previous section and copy it up to your EC2 instance and ssh in once it's copied.  scp -i geoserver-instance.pem my_new_geoserver.war ubuntu@xx.xx.xx.xx:/home/ubuntu\nssh -i geoserver-instance.pem ubuntu@xx.xx.xx.xx  From the shell the first thing you need to do is move the webapps folder in tomcat to the instance storage.  sudo /etc/init.d/tomcat8 stop\nsudo cp -rf /var/lib/tomcat8/webapps /var/lib/tomcat8/webapps.orig\nsudo mv /var/lib/tomcat8/webapps/ /mnt\nsudo ln -s /mnt/webapps /var/lib/tomcat8/webapps  and copy your uploaded geoserver  sudo cp *.war /mnt/webapps  and then restart  sudo /etc/init.d/tomcat8 start\nsudo /etc/init.d/nginx restart  If you are using geowebcache or a caching proxy you will need to change the caching dir as referenced above to also be on the /mnt drive to avoid running out of space on the EC2 boot drive.  NOTE: If the instance is stopped you will need to go through these step again when you start, since the instance storage is wiped clean in this case.

            "text": "First, read \nGetting Started\n.\n\n\nBuilding a TerriaMap against a modified TerriaJS\n\n\nWhat if you need to make changes to \nTerriaJS\n while working on a site that depends on it?\n\n\nIn the process described in \nGetting Started\n, the \nTerriaJS package\n is installed to the \nnode_modules\n directory by \nnpm install\n.  Please do not edit TerriaJS directly in the \nnode_modules\n directory, because changes will be clobbered the next time you run \nnpm install\n.\n\n\nInstead, we want to clone TerriaJS from its \nGitHub repo\n and use that in our TerriaMap build.  Traditionally, \nnpm link\n is the way to do this.  However, we do not recommend use of \nnpm link\n because it frequently leads to multiple copies of some libraries being installed, which in turn leads to all sorts of frustrating build problems.  Instead, we recommend \nyarn\n and its \nworkspaces\n feature.  \nyarn\n workspaces let us safely clone a git repo into the \npackages\n directory and wire it into any other packages that use it.\n\n\nFirst, install \nyarn\n globally:\n\n\nnpm install -g yarn\n\n\n\n\nIf you already have yarn installed, make sure it is at least v1.0 (we recommend using the latest version).  Older versions do not support the workspace feature.\n\n\nThen, enable workspaces by editing the TerriaMap \npackage.json\n file, adding these lines to the top, just after the opening \n{\n:\n\n\n  \nprivate\n: true,\n  \nworkspaces\n: {\n    \npackages\n: [\npackages/*\n],\n    \nnohoist\n: [\n**/husky\n]\n  },\n\n\n\n\nDo \nnot\n commit this change.\n\n\nNow, you can clone any package (such as \nterriajs\n or \nterriajs-cesium\n) into the \npackages\n directory:\n\n\nmkdir packages\ncd packages\ngit clone https://github.com/TerriaJS/terriajs.git\ncd ..\n\n\n\n\nThis will give you the \nmaster\n branch of TerriaJS.  While we strive to keep \nmaster\n stable and usable at all times, you must be aware that \nmaster\n is less tested than actual releases, and it may not be commpatible with the \nmaster\n branch of TerriaMap.  So, you may want to check out the actual version of TerriaJS that you're using before you start making changes.  To do that:\n\n\ngrep terriajs package.json\n# will print something like: \nterriajs\n: \n^4.5.0\n\ncd packages/terriajs\ngit checkout 4.5.0\ncd ..\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThe version of TerriaJS in your \npackages/terriajs\n directory must be semver-compatible with the version specification in TerriaMap's \npackage.json\n. If it's not, yarn will install a separate semver-compatible version of TerriaJS in \nnode_modules\n instead of using the one you've put in \npackages/terriajs\n. The version numbers are \nusually\n already aligned, but if not, change the \n\"terriajs\": \"x.y.z\"\n dependency in TerriaMap's \npackage.json\n to be the exact \n\"version\"\n property in TerriaJS's \npackage.json\n. You will generally not want to commit this change.\n\n\n\n\nThen, in the TerriaMap directory, run:\n\n\nyarn install\n\n\n\n\nYarn will:\n\n\n\n\nInstall all dependencies for both TerriaMap and any packages in your \npackages\n directory.\n\n\nInstall the \ndevDependencies\n for packages in the \npackages\n directory so you can actually develop on them.\n\n\nCreate sym-links so that everything works.\n\n\nDe-duplicate semver-compatible packages and bubble them up to the root \nnode_modules\n directory.\n\n\n\n\nNow, we can edit TerriaJS in \npackages/terriajs\n with the benefit of a full-featured git repo.\n\n\nConfirm that yarn has configured TerriaMap to use the copy of TerriaJS in \npackages/terriajs\n by verifying that \nnode_modules/terriajs\n is a symlink to \npackages/terriajs\n.  If it's not, you probably have a version conflict.  See the note above.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nRunning \nyarn install\n with workspaces configured will change \nyarn.lock\n.  Please do not commit the changes.\n\n\n\n\nTo switch TerriaMap back to using the npm version of TerriaJS (instead of the git repo), do:\n\n\n# warning: make sure you don't need any of your changes to TerriaJS first!\nrm -rf packages/terriajs\nyarn install\n\n\n\n\nCommitting modifications\n\n\nIf you make changes to TerriaJS and TerriaMap together, here's the process for getting them to production.\n\n\nFirst, commit your TerriaJS changes to a branch and open a pull request to merge that branch to master. Simultaneously, you may want to make a branch of TerriaMap that uses your modified version of TerriaJS.  To do that, modify TerriaMap's \npackage.json\n.  Where it has a line like:\n\n\nterriajs\n: \n^4.5.0\n,\n\n\n\n\nChange it to:\n\n\nterriajs\n: \ngit://github.com/TerriaJS/terriajs.git#branchName\n,\n\n\n\n\nReplace \nbranchName\n with the name of the TerriaJS branch you want to use.  You may even use a repository other than \nTerriaJS/terriajs\n if your branch is in a fork of TerriaJS instead of in the official repository.\n\n\nOnce your TerriaJS pull request has been merged and a new version of the \nterriajs\n npm module has been published, please remember to update \npackage.json\n to point to an official \nterriajs\n version instead of a branch in a GitHub repo.\n\n\nThe \npackage.json\n in the \nmaster\n branch of TerriaMap should point to official releases of \nterriajs\n on npm, NOT GitHub branches.  In other words, it is ok to commit a package.json with a git URL to a branch, but do \nnot\n merge it to master.\n\n\nDocumentation\n\n\nDocumentation is automatically generated from the source via JSDoc (reference) and MkDocs (user guide) by running:\n\n\nnpm run gulp docs\n\n\n\n\nIt will be placed in the \nwwwroot/doc\n folder.\n\n\nYou need a standalone install of MkDocs and the \nmkdocs-material\n theme in order to build the user guide. Install these by running:\n\n\npip install -r doc/requirements.txt\n\n\n\n\nTests / Specs\n\n\nWe use \nJasmine\n for the TerriaJS tests, called specs in Jasmine parlance.  To run the specs, you first need to build them by running this in the TerriaJS  (not TerriaMap!) directory:\n\n\nnpm run gulp\n\n\n\n\nAnd start the development web server by running (also from the TerriaJS and not TerriaMap! directory):\n\n\nnpm start\n\n\n\n\nThe test suite is run by opening a web browser on \nhttp://localhost:3002/SpecRunner.html\n.  The source code for the specs is found in the \ntest/\n directory.\n\n\nTerriaJS Gulp Tasks\n\n\nRun any of these tasks with \nnpm run gulp \ntask name\n from within the TerriaJS directory:\n\n\n\n\ndefault - Invoked by running gulp without any arguments, this task invokes the \nbuild\n and \nlint\n tasks.\n\n\nbuild\n - Builds a non-minified version of the TerriaJS tests.  This task may take 10 seconds or more, which is the main reason for the next task.\n\n\nwatch\n - Starts the same as \nbuild\n but then it stays running and watches for changes to any TerriaJS or Cesium source file that was pulled in to the build. When a change to any of these files is detected, a fast incremental build is automatically kicked off.  The incremental build is much faster than the full rebuild because dependencies between source files are cached.\n\n\nrelease\n - The same as \nbuild\n except that it also minifies the build tests.\n\n\nlint\n - Runs ESLint on the files in the \nlib\n folder and reports any problems.  The ESLint rules are defined in the \n.eslintrc\n file in the root directory of TerriaJS.  A stricter set of rules is also find in the \n.eslintrc\n file in \nlib/ReactViews\n.\n\n\ndocs\n - Generates the user guide and reference documentation.  The user guide is served at \nhttp://localhost:3002/doc/guide/\n and the reference documentation is at \nhttp://localhost:3002/doc/reference/\n.\n\n\nmake-schema\n - Generates \nJSON Schema\n for the TerriaJS \nInitialization Files\n from the source code.  The schema is written to \nwwwroot/schema\n.\n\n\ntest\n - Detects browsers available on the local system and launches the test suite in each.  The results are reported on the command line.\n\n\ntest-electron\n - Runs the tests in Electron, a headless (no UI) Chrome-like browser.\n\n\ntest-saucelabs\n - Runs the tests on a bunch of browsers on \nSauce Labs\n.  You will need to \nSet up Sauce Labs\n.\n\n\ntest-browserstack\n - Runs the tests on a bunch of browsers on \nBrowserStack\n.  You will need to set up a BrowserStack account.\n\n\n\n\nSee \ngulpfile.js\n for more gulp tasks.\n\n\nTerriaMap Gulp Tasks\n\n\nRun any of these tasks with \nnpm run gulp \ntask name\n from within the TerriaMap directory:\n\n\n\n\ndefault - Invoked by running gulp without any arguments, this task invokes the \nbuild\n and \nlint\n tasks.\n\n\nbuild\n - Builds a non-minified version of TerriaMap, TerriaJS, Cesium, and all other dependencies, together in one JS file (called \nwwwroot/build/TerriaMap.js\n). Only the parts of TerriaJS and Cesium that we use (directly or indirectly) are pulled in.  Web Workers, CSS, and other resources are also built by this task.  This task may take 10 seconds or more, which is the main reason for the next task.\n\n\nwatch\n - Starts the same as \nbuild\n but then it stays running and watches for changes to any TerriaMap, TerriaJS, or Cesium resource. When a change to any of these files is detected, a fast incremental build is automatically kicked off.  The incremental build is much faster than the full rebuild because dependencies between source files are cached.\n\n\nrelease\n - The same as \nbuild\n except that it also minifies the built JavaScript files.  This task should be used when building for production.\n\n\nlint\n - Runs ESLint on \nindex.js\n and the files in the \nlib\n folder and reports any problems.  The ESLint rules are defined in the \n.eslintrc\n file in the root directory of TerriaMap.\n\n\nmake-package\n - Creates a \n.tar.gz\n package in \ndeploy/packages\n from the current build.  This package can be copied to another machine to run the application there.  The arguments are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArgument\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--packageName \nname\n\n\nThe name of the package.  If not specified, the name is \nnpm_package_name\n-\ngit_describe\n, where \nnpm_package_name\n is the value of the \nnpm_package_name\n environment variable and \ngit_describe\n is the output of running \ngit describe\n.  If you invoke this task using \nnpm run gulp make-package\n instead of simply \ngulp make-package\n, the \nnpm_package_name\n environment variable will be automatically set to the name of the project in \npackage.json\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--serverConfigOverride \nfile\n\n\nThe path to a file with overrides of the \ndevserverconfig.json\n file.  If not specified, \ndevserverconfig.json\n is used unmodified.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--clientConfigOverride \nfile\n\n\nThe path to a file with overrides of the \nwwwroot/config.json\n file.  If not specified, \nwwwroot/config.json\n is used unmodified.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nclean\n - Removes the \nwwwroot/build\n directory.\n\n\nsync-terriajs-dependencies\n - For all npm packages used by both TerriaMap and TerriaJS, updates TerriaMap's \npackage.json\n to use the same version as TerriaJS.  This avoids build problems (errors, hangs) caused by package version conflicts.",

Only the parts of TerriaJS and Cesium that we use (directly or indirectly) are pulled in.  Web Workers, CSS, and other resources are also built by this task.  This task may take 10 seconds or more, which is the main reason for the next task.  watch  - Starts the same as  build  but then it stays running and watches for changes to any TerriaMap, TerriaJS, or Cesium resource. When a change to any of these files is detected, a fast incremental build is automatically kicked off.  The incremental build is much faster than the full rebuild because dependencies between source files are cached.  release  - The same as  build  except that it also minifies the built JavaScript files.  This task should be used when building for production.  lint  - Runs ESLint on  index.js  and the files in the  lib  folder and reports any problems.  The ESLint rules are defined in the  .eslintrc  file in the root directory of TerriaMap.  make-package  - Creates a  .tar.gz  package in  deploy/packages  from the current build.  This package can be copied to another machine to run the application there.  The arguments are:      Argument  Description      --packageName  name  The name of the package.  If not specified, the name is  npm_package_name - git_describe , where  npm_package_name  is the value of the  npm_package_name  environment variable and  git_describe  is the output of running  git describe .  If you invoke this task using  npm run gulp make-package  instead of simply  gulp make-package , the  npm_package_name  environment variable will be automatically set to the name of the project in  package.json .    --serverConfigOverride  file  The path to a file with overrides of the  devserverconfig.json  file.  If not specified,  devserverconfig.json  is used unmodified.    --clientConfigOverride  file  The path to a file with overrides of the  wwwroot/config.json  file.

            "text": "TerriaJS is usually used in a single-page web application to provide mapping and catalog exploration capabilities.  It is written in ECMAScript (JavaScript) 2015+ and compiled to ECMAScript 5 in order to run in any relatively modern web browser, including Internet Explorer 9 or later.  Some features, such as 3D and vector tile region mapping, require more recent browsers, but TerriaJS can be expected to degrade gracefully in older browsers by disabling unsupported features or informing the user of the limitations of their browser. \n\n\nLayers\n\n\nTerriaJS has a number of subdirectories of the \nlib\n directory, each of which corresponds to a conceptual layer in the design of TerriaJS.  The layers are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName\n\n\nPurpose\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThirdParty\n\n\nThis directory contains third-party code that is not available via npm packages for whatever reason.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCore\n\n\nLow-level utility classes and functions that don't depend on a UI toolkit (i.e. React) or a mapping library (i.e. Cesium or Leaflet).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMap\n\n\nClasses and functions to work with or extend a mapping library (i.e. Cesium or Leaflet). This layer should not depend on a particular UI toolkit (i.e. React).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharts\n\n\nSimilar to the \nMap\n layer, except for charting instead of mapping.  This depends on the charting library (D3) but not on React.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModels\n\n\nThis is heart of TerriaJS.  Classes and functions in this layer know how to interface with catalog servers, map servers, and geospatial data formats.  Most of the logic of a TerriaJS application is found in this layer.  However, it does \nnot\n depend on React.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViewModels and ReactViewModels\n\n\nContains classes and functions that are closely associated with the UI but cannot be described as React components or views.  These two directories are separate mostly for historical reasons; there is little practical difference between them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReactViews\n\n\nThis is the React-based user interface of TerriaJS.  All of the React components are found in this layer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUser interface\n\n\nTerriaJS uses the \nReact\n library as the basis for its user interface.  The top-level entry point is \nStandardUserInterface.jsx\n.  It is expected that most applications will use this standard user interface, but a sophisticated TerriaJS application could use its own version instead in order to allow extreme customization of the interface.\n\n\nFor styling, we use \nSass\n in CSS modules loaded via the Webpack \ncss-loader\n, meaning that each React component imports its own local CSS styles from a \n.scss\n file.\n\n\nThe user interface is meant to be a thin layer with minimal domain-specific logic.  Ideally, all domain-specific logic would reside in the \nModels\n layer or perhaps in the \nViewModels\n layer.  This approach allows the UI to be replaced (including by a user of TerriaJS rather than its developers) without needing to re-implement large chunks of TerriaJS logic.  In fact, the entire user interface can be viewed as optional.  A TerriaJS-based application could replace it with its own custom UI.\n\n\nObservables and ObserveModelMixin\n\n\nVirtually all TerriaJS state is stored in instances of classes in the \nModels\n and \nViewModels\n layers.  Many changes to this state are initiated by actions in the user interface.  For example, the user clicks an \nAdd to Map\n button and a number of state changes take place that eventually cause the catalog item to appear on the map.\n\n\nSome changes, however, come from elsewhere.  For example, when the user drags a JSON catalog file onto the map, this may cause any number of changes to objects in the \nModels\n layer.  In addition, the \nModels\n layer itself is usable as an API for TerriaJS.  Developers can add custom user interface components or other functionality that manipulate the objects in the \nModels\n layer.  It's important that the user interface update to reflect the new state, whether the state change was initiated by the core TerriaJS UI or not.\n\n\nTo that end, most of the properties of objects in the \nModels\n and \nViewModels\n layers are observable.  Near the bottom of the constructor of most model objects (\nUrlTemplateCatalogItem\n for example), you'll see a line like this:\n\n\nknockout.track(this, ['minimumLevel', 'maximumLevel', 'attribution', 'subdomains', 'tileDiscardPolicy']);\n\n\n\n\nknockout.track\n transforms each of the named properties on the given object (\nthis\n in this case) into an observable property.  A Knockout observable property is just like a normal property; you can get and set its value as normal.  On top of that, however, an observable property raises an event when it changes.  For example, if we have a \nUrlTemplateCatalogItem\n instance in a variable named \nurlTemplateCatalogItem\n, we can subscribe to its \nminimumLevel\n property like this:\n\n\nknockout.getObservable(urlTemplateCatalogItem, 'minimumLevel').subscribe(function() {\n    alert('minimumLevel changed!');\n});\n\n\n\n\nMany model classes also define computed properties, which are defined using either \noverrideProperty\n or \nknockout.defineProperty\n.  Computed properties have a getter and optionally a setter.  The getter is invoked once the first time the property is accessed and the value is memoized (cached).  Further accesses of the property will get the memoized value.\n\n\nHowever, Knockout automatically keeps track of the set of observables (including other computed observables) that were accessed during the execution of the getter.  If any of \nthose\n properties change, the computed observable's getter will be invoked again and the new value memoized.  This new invocation may access different observables properties than it did the first time around, and it is those new properties that will trigger any future re-evaluations of the computed property.  We can subscribe to change notification on computed properties in the same way we subscribe to regular observable properties.\n\n\nIt's rarely necessary to explicitly subscribe to an observable, though.  In the React components in the TerriaJS user interface, we use a React mix-in called \nObserveModelMixin\n.  When this mix-in is included in a component, the React \nrender\n method acts a bit like a computed observable.  It automatically keeps track of all the observables that were read in the course of rendering the component.  If any of them change, the component will be automatically re-rendered.\n\n\nWith \nObserveModelMixin\n, in most cases it's not necessary to think very much about the TerriaJS state when developing the UI.  Just write your \nrender\n method as a pure function that produces virtual DOM nodes from the current state of the application, and rest assured that your \nrender\n method will be called again if that state ever changes in a way that might affect what is shown to the user.\n\n\nFor more details of Knockout observables, see \nKnockout-ES5\n as well as the main \nKnockout documentation\n.\n\n\nIt may seem a bit stange that we're using Knockout, which is itself a user interface framework, in a library that uses React for its user interface.  In fact, we're not using the UI or DOM manipulation parts of Knockout at all.  We're only using it as an observable library.  Knockout's observables are feature rich and well tested, and make a great complement to React when paired with our \nObserveModelMixin\n.\n\n\nMajor Components in Models\n\n\nTo help understand the code in Models, here is a summary of some of the major components of TerriaJS:\n\n\nTerria\n\n\nThe root of the TerriaJS application state. A TerriaJS-based application typically has only one \nTerria\n instance, though it is possible to have more in unusual situations.  All other objects can generally be found via this instance.\n\n\nCatalog\n\n\nThe TerriaJS catalog, built up from JSON init files as described in the \nCustomizing\n section.  The \nCatalog\n is what you're looking at when you press the \nAdd data\n button the UI.  It is accessible from the \ncatalog\n property on the \nTerria\n instance.\n\n\nNowViewing\n\n\nAlso known as the Workbench, this is shown in the panel on the left side of the UI, under the Add Data button.  This is the set of all enabled catalog items.  When the \nisEnabled\n property is set to true on a \nCatalogItem\n, it will appear here.  It is accessible from the \nnowViewing\n property on the \nTerria\n instance.\n\n\nCatalogMember\n\n\nThis is the base class for everything in the catalog, including \nCatalogGroup\n, \nCatalogItem\n, and \nCatalogFunction\n.\n\n\nCatalogGroup\n\n\nA group of items in the catalog, shown as a folder in the UI.  The \nCatalogGroup\n class itself has a fixed set of items it holds, but derived classes can and do dynamically load their list of items from a remote server.  For a list of available catalog groups, see \nCatalog Groups\n.\n\n\nCatalogItem\n\n\nA catalog item can be enabled by settings its \nisEnabled\n property to \ntrue\n, at which point it appears in the Now Viewing / Workbench.  Usually an enabled catalog item also has a representation on the map and / or on the chart panel, though this is not strictly required.  For a list of available catalog items, see \nCatalog Items\n.\n\n\nCatalogFunction\n\n\nUnlike a \nCatalogItem\n, a \nCatalogFunction\n cannot be directly enabled.  Instead, the user supplies parameters to the function and invokes it, and the result is a \nCatalogItem\n that is shown on the Workbench.  A Web Processing Service (WPS) is an excellent example of a \nCatalogFunction\n.  For a list of available catalog functions, see \nCatalog Functions\n.\n\n\nGlobeOrMap\n\n\nThe base class for a map view.  TerriaJS currently includes derived classes for a 3D view based on \nCesium\n (\nCesium\n class) and a 2D view based on \nLeaflet\n (\nLeaflet\n class).\n\n\nMapping\n\n\nAll mapping in TerriaJS happens through the abstractions provided by \nCesium\n.  Whether you're using the 3D Cesium view or the 2D Leaflet view, raster map layers are represented using Cesium's \nImageryProvider\n type and vector layers are represented using Cesium's \nDataSource\n and \nEntity\n types.\n\n\nCesium's \ntutorials\n are a great introduction to these topics, especially the \nImagery Layers\n and \nVisualizing Spatial Data\n tutorials.\n\n\nThe code that renders these Cesium types on a Leaflet map is found in the \nMap\n layer, particularly \nCesiumTileLayer\n and \nLeafletVisualizer\n.\n\n\nIn some specialized cases, such as \nCesiumTerrainCatalogItem\n, catalog items directly interact with an underlying mapping engine rather than using the \nImageryProvider\n and \nDataSource\n abstractions.\n\n\nBuild Architecture\n\n\nTerriaJS and TerriaJS-based applications are built using \nWebpack\n.  A number of Webpack loaders are used to handle the various types of assets and transformations that TerriaJS requires.  An application that uses TerriaJS is expected to set up Webpack for its own needs and then call \nconfigureWebpack\n to configure Webpack for TerriaJS.  \nconfigureWebpack\n takes care to avoid impacting Webpack configuration outside of TerriaJS itself.\n\n\nIt may be possible to build a TerriaJS application using a tool other than Webpack, such as Browserify or Rollup, but it is unlikely to be easy.  If you decide to attempt this, consider dropping by \nGitter\n or the \nTerriaJS forum\n.",

This software contains the following license and notice below:\n\n\nGNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n                       Version 3, 19 November 2007\n\n\nCopyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. \nhttps://fsf.org/\n\n Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\n of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\n\n                        Preamble\n\n\n\nThe GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license for\nsoftware and other kinds of works, specifically designed to ensure\ncooperation with the community in the case of network server software.\n\n\nThe licenses for most software and other practical works are designed\nto take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,\nour General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to\nshare and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\nsoftware for all its users.\n\n\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthem if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\nwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\nfree programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n\n\nDevelopers that use our General Public Licenses protect your rights\nwith two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer\nyou this License which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute\nand/or modify the software.\n\n\nA secondary benefit of defending all users' freedom is that\nimprovements made in alternate versions of the program, if they\nreceive widespread use, become available for other developers to\nincorporate.  Many developers of free software are heartened and\nencouraged by the resulting cooperation.  However, in the case of\nsoftware used on network servers, this result may fail to come about.\nThe GNU General Public License permits making a modified version and\nletting the public access it on a server without ever releasing its\nsource code to the public.\n\n\nThe GNU Affero General Public License is designed specifically to\nensure that, in such cases, the modified source code becomes available\nto the community.  It requires the operator of a network server to\nprovide the source code of the modified version running there to the\nusers of that server.  Therefore, public use of a modified version, on\na publicly accessible server, gives the public access to the source\ncode of the modified version.\n\n\nAn older license, called the Affero General Public License and\npublished by Affero, was designed to accomplish similar goals.  This is\na different license, not a version of the Affero GPL, but Affero has\nreleased a new version of the Affero GPL which permits relicensing under\nthis license.\n\n\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n\n                   TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinitions.\n\n\n\n\n\"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License.\n\n\n\"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\nworks, such as semiconductor masks.\n\n\n\"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\nLicense.  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  \"Licensees\" and\n\"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\n\n\nTo \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\nin a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\nexact copy.  The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the\nearlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\n\n\nA \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\non the Program.\n\n\nTo \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\npermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\ninfringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\ncomputer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\ndistribution (with or without modification), making available to the\npublic, and in some countries other activities as well.\n\n\nTo \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\nparties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through\na computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n\n\nAn interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\"\nto the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\nfeature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\ntells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\nextent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\nwork under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\nthe interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\nmenu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\n\n\n\nSource Code.\n\n\n\n\nThe \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work\nfor making modifications to it.  \"Object code\" means any non-source\nform of a work.\n\n\nA \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official\nstandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\ninterfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\nis widely used among developers working in that language.\n\n\nThe \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other\nthan the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\npackaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\nComponent, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\nMajor Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\nimplementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\n\"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component\n(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\n(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\nproduce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n\n\nThe \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all\nthe source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\nwork) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\ncontrol those activities.  However, it does not include the work's\nSystem Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\nprograms which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\nwhich are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\nincludes interface definition files associated with source files for\nthe work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\nlinked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\nsuch as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\nsubprograms and other parts of the work.\n\n\nThe Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\ncan regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\nSource.\n\n\nThe Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\nsame work.\n\n\n\n\nBasic Permissions.\n\n\n\n\nAll rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\ncopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\nconditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\npermission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a\ncovered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\ncontent, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your\nrights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n\n\nYou may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\nconvey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\nin force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\nof having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\nwith facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\nthe terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\nnot control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works\nfor you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\nand control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\nyour copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n\n\nConveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\nthe conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\nmakes it unnecessary.\n\n\n\n\nProtecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n\n\n\n\nNo covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\nmeasure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\n11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\nsimilar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\nmeasures.\n\n\nWhen you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\ncircumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\nis effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\nthe covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\nmodification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\nusers, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\ntechnological measures.\n\n\n\n\nConveying Verbatim Copies.\n\n\n\n\nYou may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\nreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\nkeep intact all notices stating that this License and any\nnon-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\nkeep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\nrecipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\n\nYou may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\nand you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\n\n\n\nConveying Modified Source Versions.\n\n\n\n\nYou may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\nproduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\nterms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n\na) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\nit, and giving a relevant date.\n\nb) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\nreleased under this License and any conditions added under section\n7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\n\"keep intact all notices\".\n\nc) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\nLicense to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\nLicense will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\nadditional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\nregardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\npermission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\ninvalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n\nd) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\nAppropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\ninterfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\nwork need not make them do so.\n\n\n\nA compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\nworks, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\nand which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\nin or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\n\"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\nused to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\nbeyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work\nin an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\nparts of the aggregate.\n\n\n\n\nConveying Non-Source Forms.\n\n\n\n\nYou may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\nof sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\nmachine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\nin one of these ways:\n\n\na) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\nCorresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\ncustomarily used for software interchange.\n\nb) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\nwritten offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\nlong as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\nmodel, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\ncopy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\nproduct that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\nmedium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\nmore than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\nconveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\nCorresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n\nc) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\nwritten offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\nalternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\nonly if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\nwith subsection 6b.\n\nd) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\nplace (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\nCorresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\nfurther charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\nCorresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\ncopy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\nmay be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\nthat supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\nclear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\nCorresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\nCorresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\navailable for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n\ne) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\nyou inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\nSource of the work are being offered to the general public at no\ncharge under subsection 6d.\n\n\n\nA separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\nfrom the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\nincluded in conveying the object code work.\n\n\nA \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any\ntangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\nor household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\ninto a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\ndoubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular\nproduct received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a\ntypical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\nof the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\nactually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product\nis a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\ncommercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\nthe only significant mode of use of the product.\n\n\n\"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods,\nprocedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\nand execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\na modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must\nsuffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\ncode is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\nmodification has been made.\n\n\nIf you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\nspecifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\npart of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\nUser Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\nfixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\nCorresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\nby the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply\nif neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\nmodified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\nbeen installed in ROM).\n\n\nThe requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\nrequirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\nfor a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\nthe User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a\nnetwork may be denied when the modification itself materially and\nadversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\nprotocols for communication across the network.\n\n\nCorresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\nin accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\ndocumented (and with an implementation available to the public in\nsource code form), and must require no special password or key for\nunpacking, reading or copying.\n\n\n\n\nAdditional Terms.\n\n\n\n\n\"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this\nLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\nAdditional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\nbe treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\nthat they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions\napply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\nunder those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\nthis License without regard to the additional permissions.\n\n\nWhen you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\nremove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\nit.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\nremoval in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place\nadditional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\nfor which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n\n\nNotwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\nadd to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\nthat material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\n\na) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\nterms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n\nb) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\nauthor attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\nNotices displayed by works containing it; or\n\nc) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\nrequiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\nreasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n\nd) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\nauthors of the material; or\n\ne) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\ntrade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\nf) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\nmaterial by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\nit) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\nany liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\nthose licensors and authors.\n\n\n\nAll other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further\nrestrictions\" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you\nreceived it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\ngoverned by this License along with a term that is a further\nrestriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains\na further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\nLicense, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\nof that license document, provided that the further restriction does\nnot survive such relicensing or conveying.\n\n\nIf you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\nmust place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\nadditional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\nwhere to find the applicable terms.\n\n\nAdditional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\nform of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\nthe above requirements apply either way.\n\n\n\n\nTermination.\n\n\n\n\nYou may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\nprovided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\nmodify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\nthis License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\nparagraph of section 11).\n\n\nHowever, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\nlicense from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\nprovisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\nfinally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\nholder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\nprior to 60 days after the cessation.\n\n\nMoreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\nreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\nviolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\nreceived notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\ncopyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\nyour receipt of the notice.\n\n\nTermination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\nlicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\nthis License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\nreinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\nmaterial under section 10.\n\n\n\n\nAcceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n\n\n\n\nYou are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\nrun a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work\noccurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\nto receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,\nnothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\nmodify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do\nnot accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\ncovered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n\n\n\nAutomatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n\n\n\n\nEach time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\nreceives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\npropagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible\nfor enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n\n\nAn \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an\norganization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\norganization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered\nwork results from an entity transaction, each party to that\ntransaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\nlicenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\ngive under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\nCorresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\nthe predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n\n\nYou may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\nrights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may\nnot impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\nrights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\nany patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\nsale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\n\n\n\nPatents.\n\n\n\n\nA \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\nLicense of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The\nwork thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\n\n\nA contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims\nowned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\nhereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\nby this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\nbut do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\nconsequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For\npurposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant\npatent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\nthis License.\n\n\nEach contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\npatent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\nmake, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\npropagate the contents of its contributor version.\n\n\nIn the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express\nagreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\n(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\nsue for patent infringement).  To \"grant\" such a patent license to a\nparty means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\npatent against the party.\n\n\nIf you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\nand the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\nto copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\npublicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\nthen you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\navailable, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\npatent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\nconsistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\nlicense to downstream recipients.  \"Knowingly relying\" means you have\nactual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\ncovered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\nin a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\ncountry that you have reason to believe are valid.\n\n\nIf, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\narrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\ncovered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\nreceiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\nor convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\nyou grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\nwork and works based on it.\n\n\nA patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within\nthe scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\nconditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\nspecifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered\nwork if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\nin the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\nto the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\nthe work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\nparties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\npatent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\nconveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\nfor and in connection with specific products or compilations that\ncontain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\nor that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n\n\nNothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\nany implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\notherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\n\n\n\nNo Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n\n\n\n\nIf conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a\ncovered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\nnot convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\nto collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\nthe Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\nLicense would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\n\n\n\nRemote Network Interaction; Use with the GNU General Public License.\n\n\n\n\nNotwithstanding any other provision of this License, if you modify the\nProgram, your modified version must prominently offer all users\ninteracting with it remotely through a computer network (if your version\nsupports such interaction) an opportunity to receive the Corresponding\nSource of your version by providing access to the Corresponding Source\nfrom a network server at no charge, through some standard or customary\nmeans of facilitating copying of software.  This Corresponding Source\nshall include the Corresponding Source for any work covered by version 3\nof the GNU General Public License that is incorporated pursuant to the\nfollowing paragraph.\n\n\nNotwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\npermission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\nunder version 3 of the GNU General Public License into a single\ncombined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this\nLicense will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\nbut the work with which it is combined will remain governed by version\n3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n\n\n\nRevised Versions of this License.\n\n\n\n\nThe Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\nthe GNU Affero General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions\nwill be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the\nProgram specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Affero General\nPublic License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the\noption of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered\nversion or of any later version published by the Free Software\nFoundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the\nGNU Affero General Public License, you may choose any version ever published\nby the Free Software Foundation.\n\n\nIf the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\nversions of the GNU Affero General Public License can be used, that proxy's\npublic statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\nto choose that version for the Program.\n\n\nLater license versions may give you additional or different\npermissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\nauthor or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\nlater version.\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer of Warranty.\n\n\n\n\nTHERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\nAPPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\nHOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY\nOF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,\nTHE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM\nIS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF\nALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n\n\n\nLimitation of Liability.\n\n\n\n\nIN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS\nTHE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\nGENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE\nUSE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF\nDATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD\nPARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),\nEVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\nSUCH DAMAGES.\n\n\n\n\nInterpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\n\n\n\n\nIf the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided\nabove cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,\nreviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates\nan absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the\nProgram, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a\ncopy of the Program in return for a fee.\n\n\n                 END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n        How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n\n\nIf you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n\nTo do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nstate the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n\none line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.\n\nCopyright (C) \nyear\n  \nname of author\n\n\nThis program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\nit under the terms of the GNU Affero General Public License as published by\nthe Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n(at your option) any later version.\n\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\nGNU Affero General Public License for more details.\n\nYou should have received a copy of the GNU Affero General Public License\nalong with this program.  If not, see \nhttps://www.gnu.org/licenses/\n.\n\n\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\n\nIf your software can interact with users remotely through a computer\nnetwork, you should also make sure that it provides a way for users to\nget its source.  For example, if your program is a web application, its\ninterface could display a \"Source\" link that leads users to an archive\nof the code.  There are many ways you could offer source, and different\nsolutions will be better for different programs; see section 13 for the\nspecific requirements.\n\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,\nif any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary.\nFor more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU AGPL, see\n\nhttps://www.gnu.org/licenses/\n.\n\n\n\n\nThe following software may be included in this product: @pm2/io.

Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or\n     any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights\n     that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.\n\n\nf.

No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose\n           any additional or different terms or conditions on, or\n           apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the\n           Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the\n           Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed\n           Material.\n\n   6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or\n      may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You\n      are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected\n      with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,\n      the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as\n      provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).\n\n\n\nb. Other rights.\n\n\n   1.

Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this\n      Public License.\n\n   3.

In all other cases the Licensor expressly\n      reserves any right to collect such royalties.\n\n\n\nSection 3 -- License Conditions.\n\n\nYour exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the\nfollowing conditions.\n\n\na.

If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified\n      form), You must:\n\n        a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor\n           with the Licensed Material:\n\n             i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed\n                Material and any others designated to receive\n                attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by\n                the Licensor (including by pseudonym if\n                designated);\n\n            ii. a copyright notice;\n\n           iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;\n\n            iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of\n                warranties;\n\n             v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the\n                extent reasonably practicable;\n\n        b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and\n           retain an indication of any previous modifications; and\n\n        c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this\n           Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or\n           hyperlink to, this Public License.\n\n   2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any\n      reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in\n      which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be\n      reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or\n      hyperlink to a resource that includes the required\n      information.\n\n   3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the\n      information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent\n      reasonably practicable.\n\n   4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's\n      License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted\n      Material from complying with this Public License.\n\n\n\nSection 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.\n\n\nWhere the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that\napply to Your use of the Licensed Material:\n\n\na. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right\n     to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial\n     portion of the contents of the database;\n\n\nb. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database\n     contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database\n     Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database\n     Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and\n\n\nc. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share\n     all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.\n\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not\nreplace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed\nRights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.\n\n\nSection 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.\n\n\na. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE\n     EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS\n     AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF\n     ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,\n     IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,\n     WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\n     PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,\n     ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT\n     KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT\n     ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n\nb. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE\n     TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,\n     NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,\n     INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,\n     COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR\n     USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN\n     ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR\n     DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR\n     IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n\nc. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided\n     above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent\n     possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and\n     waiver of all liability.\n\n\nSection 6 -- Term and Termination.\n\n\na. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and\n     Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with\n     this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License\n     terminate automatically.\n\n\nb. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under\n     Section 6(a), it reinstates:\n\n\n   1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided\n      it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the\n      violation; or\n\n   2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.\n\n For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any\n right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations\n of this Public License.\n\n\n\nc. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the\n     Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop\n     distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so\n     will not terminate this Public License.\n\n\nd. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public\n     License.\n\n\nSection 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.\n\n\na. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different\n     terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.\n\n\nb. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the\n     Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and\n     independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n\n\nSection 8 -- Interpretation.\n\n\na. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and\n     shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose\n     conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully\n     be made without permission under this Public License.\n\n\nb. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is\n     deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the\n     minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision\n     cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License\n     without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and\n     conditions.\n\n\nc. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no\n     failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the\n     Licensor.\n\n\nd. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted\n     as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities\n     that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal\n     processes of any jurisdiction or authority.\n\n\n=======================================================================\n\n\nCreative Commons is not a party to its public\nlicenses.

Conditions\n\n\n Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted in\n Section 2.1.\n\n\n\n\n\nResponsibilities\n\n\n\n\n3.1. Distribution of Source Form\n\n\n All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any\n Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under the\n terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form\n of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this License, and how\n they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not attempt to alter or\n restrict the recipients\u2019 rights in the Source Code Form.\n\n\n\n3.2. Distribution of Executable Form\n\n\n If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:\n\n a. such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form,\n    as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the\n    Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by\n    reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost\n    of distribution to the recipient; and\n\n b. You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this License,\n    or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the license for\n    the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients\u2019\n    rights in the Source Code Form under this License.\n\n\n\n3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work\n\n\n You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,\n provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for the\n Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software\n with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered\n Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License permits\n You to additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of\n such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at\n their option, further distribute the Covered Software under the terms of\n either this License or such Secondary License(s).\n\n\n\n3.4. Notices\n\n\n You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices (including\n copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations\n of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the Covered\n Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the extent\n required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.\n\n\n\n3.5. Application of Additional Terms\n\n\n You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,\n indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered\n Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf\n of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such\n warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You\n alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any\n liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,\n indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional\n disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any\n jurisdiction.\n\n\n\n\n\nInability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation\n\n\n\n\nIf it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License\n   with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial\n   order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License\n   to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code\n   they affect. Such description must be placed in a text file included with all\n   distributions of the Covered Software under this License. Except to the\n   extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be\n   sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to\n   understand it.\n\n\n\n\nTermination\n\n\n\n\n5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You\n     fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant,\n     then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor\n     are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor\n     explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing basis,\n     if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some\n     reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have come back into compliance.\n     Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are reinstated on an\n     ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by\n     some reasonable means, this is the first time You have received notice of\n     non-compliance with this License from such Contributor, and You become\n     compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt of the notice.\n\n\n5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent\n     infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims,\n     and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or\n     indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and\n     all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this License\n     shall terminate.\n\n\n5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user\n     license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been\n     validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to\n     termination shall survive termination.\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer of Warranty\n\n\n\n\nCovered Software is provided under this License on an \u201cas is\u201d basis, without\n   warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including,\n   without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free of defects,\n   merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire\n   risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You.\n   Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You (not any\n   Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or\n   correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of this\n   License. No use of  any Covered Software is authorized under this License\n   except under this disclaimer.\n\n\n\n\nLimitation of Liability\n\n\n\n\nUnder no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including\n   negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who\n   distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any\n   direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any\n   character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of\n   goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n   other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been\n   informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability\n   shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such\n   party\u2019s negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation.\n   Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or\n   consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.\n\n\n\n\nLitigation\n\n\n\n\nAny litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of\n   a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business\n   and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without\n   reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall\n   prevent a party\u2019s ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims.\n\n\n\n\nMiscellaneous\n\n\n\n\nThis License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter\n   hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such\n   provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it\n   enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a\n   contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not be used to construe\n   this License against a Contributor.\n\n\n\n\nVersions of the License\n\n\n\n\n10.1. New Versions\n\n\n  Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section\n  10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or\n  publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a\n  distinguishing version number.\n\n\n\n10.2. Effect of New Versions\n\n\n  You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version of\n  the License under which You originally received the Covered Software, or\n  under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license\n  steward.\n\n\n\n10.3. Modified Versions\n\n\n  If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to\n  create a new license for such software, you may create and use a modified\n  version of this License if you rename the license and remove any\n  references to the name of the license steward (except to note that such\n  modified license differs from this License).\n\n\n\n10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary Licenses\n      If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With\n      Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the\n      notice described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached.\n\n\nExhibit A - Source Code Form License Notice\n\n\n  This Source Code Form is subject to the\n  terms of the Mozilla Public License, v.\n  2.0.

However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n\nAPPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n\n  To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n  boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"{}\"\n  replaced with your own identifying information.

By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicense is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\nsoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\nGeneral Public License applies to most of the Free Software\nFoundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\nusing it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\nthe GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\nif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\nin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n\n\nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\ndistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\n\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\nyou have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\nrights.\n\n\nWe protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\ndistribute and/or modify the software.\n\n\nAlso, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\nsoftware.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\nthat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\nauthors' reputations.\n\n\nFinally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\npatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\nprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\nprogram proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\npatent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n\n\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n\n    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n\n\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n\n\n\nThis License applies to any program or other work which contains\na notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\nunder the terms of this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below,\nrefers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"\nmeans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\nthat is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\neither verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\nlanguage.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\nthe term \"modification\".)  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\n\n\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\nis covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\nProgram (independent of having been made by running the Program).\nWhether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n\n\n\n\nYou may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\nsource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\nconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\ncopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\nnotices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\nand give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\nalong with the Program.\n\n\n\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\nyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n\na) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\nstating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n\nb) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\nwhole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\npart thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\nparties under the terms of this License.\n\n\nc) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\nwhen run, you must cause it, when started running for such\ninteractive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\nannouncement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\nnotice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\na warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\nthese conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\nLicense.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\ndoes not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\nthe Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Program.\n\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\nwith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\nSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n\na) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\nsource code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\n1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n\nb) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\nyears, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\ncost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\nmachine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\ndistributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\ncustomarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n\nc) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\nto distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\nallowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\nreceived the program in object code or executable form with such\nan offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\ncode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\nassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\ncontrol compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\nspecial exception, the source code distributed need not include\nanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\nform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\noperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\nitself accompanies the executable.\n\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\naccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\naccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as\ndistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\nexcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\notherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\nvoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\nHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\nthis License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\nparties remain in full compliance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Program or works based on it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEach time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\nthese terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\nthis License.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\nthose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\nlater version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\neither of that version or of any later version published by the Free\nSoftware Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\nthis License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\nFoundation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\nto ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\nSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\nmake exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\nof preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\nof promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\n\n  NO WARRANTY\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\nFOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\nOTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\nPROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS\nTO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE\nPROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\nREPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR\nREDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\nINCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING\nOUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\nTO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY\nYOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\nPROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following software may be included in this product: node-gyp.

If You\n      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a\n      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work\n      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct\n      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses\n      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate\n      as of the date such litigation is filed.    Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\n      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\n      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\n      meet the following conditions:  (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\n      Derivative Works a copy of this License; and  (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\n      stating that You changed the files; and  (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n      that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n      attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\n      excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\n      the Derivative Works; and  (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n      distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n      include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n      within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n      pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\n      of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n      as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\n      documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\n      within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\n      wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\n      of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n      do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n      notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n      or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n      that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n      as modifying the License.  You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n  may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n  for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n  for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n  reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n  the conditions stated in this License.    Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.    Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.    Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.    Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.    Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

The\nfollowing considerations are for informational purposes only, are not\nexhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.   Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are\n intended for use by those authorized to give the public\n permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by\n copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are\n irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms\n and conditions of the license they choose before applying it.\n Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before\n applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the\n material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any\n material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-\n licensed material, or material used under an exception or\n limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors:\nwiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensors\n\n Considerations for the public: By using one of our public\n licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the\n licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If\n the licensor's permission is not necessary for any reason--for\n example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to\n copyright--then that use is not regulated by the license. Our\n licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain\n other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of\n the licensed material may still be restricted for other\n reasons, including because others have copyright or other\n rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests,\n such as asking that all changes be marked or described.\n Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to\n respect those requests where reasonable. More_considerations\n for the public: \nwiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensees  =======================================================================  Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License  By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree\nto be bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons\nAttribution 4.0 International Public License (\"Public License\"). To the\nextent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are\ngranted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of\nthese terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in\nconsideration of benefits the Licensor receives from making the\nLicensed Material available under these terms and conditions.  Section 1 -- Definitions.  a. Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar\n     Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material\n     and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered,\n     arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring\n     permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the\n     Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed\n     Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording,\n     Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is\n     synched in timed relation with a moving image.  b. Adapter's License means the license You apply to Your Copyright\n     and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in\n     accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License.  c. Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights\n     closely related to copyright including, without limitation,\n     performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database\n     Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or\n     categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights\n     specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar\n     Rights.  d. Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the\n     absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws\n     fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright\n     Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international\n     agreements.  e. Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or\n     any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights\n     that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.  f. Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database,\n     or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public\n     License.  g. Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the\n     terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to\n     all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the\n     Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.  h. Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights\n     under this Public License.  i. Share means to provide material to the public by any means or\n     process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such\n     as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution,\n     dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material\n     available to the public including in ways that members of the\n     public may access the material from a place and at a time\n     individually chosen by them.  j. Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright\n     resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of\n     the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases,\n     as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially\n     equivalent rights anywhere in the world.  k. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights\n     under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.  Section 2 -- Scope.  a. License grant.     1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,\n      the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,\n      non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to\n      exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:\n\n        a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or\n           in part; and\n\n        b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.\n\n   2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where\n      Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public\n      License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with\n      its terms and conditions.\n\n   3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section\n      6(a).\n\n   4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The\n      Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in\n      all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,\n      and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The\n      Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or\n      authority to forbid You from making technical modifications\n      necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including\n      technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective\n      Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,\n      simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)\n      (4) never produces Adapted Material.\n\n   5. Downstream recipients.\n\n        a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every\n           recipient of the Licensed Material automatically\n           receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the\n           Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this\n           Public License.\n\n        b. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose\n           any additional or different terms or conditions on, or\n           apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the\n           Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the\n           Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed\n           Material.\n\n   6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or\n      may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You\n      are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected\n      with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,\n      the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as\n      provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).  b. Other rights.     1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not\n      licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,\n      privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to\n      the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to\n      assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited\n      extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed\n      Rights, but not otherwise.\n\n   2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this\n      Public License.\n\n   3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to\n      collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed\n      Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society\n      under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory\n      licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly\n      reserves any right to collect such royalties.  Section 3 -- License Conditions.  Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the\nfollowing conditions.  a. Attribution.     1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified\n      form), You must:\n\n        a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor\n           with the Licensed Material:\n\n             i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed\n                Material and any others designated to receive\n                attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by\n                the Licensor (including by pseudonym if\n                designated);\n\n            ii. a copyright notice;\n\n           iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;\n\n            iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of\n                warranties;\n\n             v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the\n                extent reasonably practicable;\n\n        b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and\n           retain an indication of any previous modifications; and\n\n        c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this\n           Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or\n           hyperlink to, this Public License.\n\n   2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any\n      reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in\n      which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be\n      reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or\n      hyperlink to a resource that includes the required\n      information.\n\n   3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the\n      information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent\n      reasonably practicable.\n\n   4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's\n      License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted\n      Material from complying with this Public License.  Section 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.  Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that\napply to Your use of the Licensed Material:  a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right\n     to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial\n     portion of the contents of the database;  b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database\n     contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database\n     Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database\n     Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and  c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share\n     all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.  For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not\nreplace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed\nRights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.  Section 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.  a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE\n     EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS\n     AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF\n     ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,\n     IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,\n     WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\n     PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,\n     ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT\n     KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT\n     ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.  b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE\n     TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,\n     NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,\n     INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,\n     COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR\n     USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN\n     ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR\n     DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR\n     IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.  c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided\n     above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent\n     possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and\n     waiver of all liability.  Section 6 -- Term and Termination.  a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and\n     Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with\n     this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License\n     terminate automatically.  b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under\n     Section 6(a), it reinstates:     1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided\n      it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the\n      violation; or\n\n   2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.\n\n For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any\n right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations\n of this Public License.  c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the\n     Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop\n     distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so\n     will not terminate this Public License.  d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public\n     License.  Section 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.  a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different\n     terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.  b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the\n     Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and\n     independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.  Section 8 -- Interpretation.  a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and\n     shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose\n     conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully\n     be made without permission under this Public License.  b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is\n     deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the\n     minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision\n     cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License\n     without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and\n     conditions.  c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no\n     failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the\n     Licensor.  d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted\n     as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities\n     that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal\n     processes of any jurisdiction or authority.  =======================================================================  Creative Commons is not a party to its public\nlicenses.

GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n       Version 2, June 1991  Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\n 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA\n Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\n of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.        Preamble  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your\nfreedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicense is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\nsoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\nGeneral Public License applies to most of the Free Software\nFoundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\nusing it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\nthe GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\nif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\nin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\ndistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\nyou have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\nrights.  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\ndistribute and/or modify the software.  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\nsoftware.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\nthat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\nauthors' reputations.  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\npatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\nprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\nprogram proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\npatent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.      GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE  TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION   This License applies to any program or other work which contains\na notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\nunder the terms of this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below,\nrefers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"\nmeans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\nthat is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\neither verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\nlanguage.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\nthe term \"modification\".)  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".   Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\nis covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\nProgram (independent of having been made by running the Program).\nWhether that is true depends on what the Program does.   You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\nsource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\nconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\ncopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\nnotices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\nand give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\nalong with the Program.   You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\nyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.    You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:  a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\nstating that you changed the files and the date of any change.  b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\nwhole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\npart thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\nparties under the terms of this License.  c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\nwhen run, you must cause it, when started running for such\ninteractive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\nannouncement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\nnotice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\na warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\nthese conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\nLicense.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\ndoes not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\nthe Program is not required to print an announcement.)    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.  Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Program.  In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\nwith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.    You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\nSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:  a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\nsource code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\n1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,  b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\nyears, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\ncost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\nmachine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\ndistributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\ncustomarily used for software interchange; or,  c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\nto distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\nallowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\nreceived the program in object code or executable form with such\nan offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)    The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\ncode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\nassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\ncontrol compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\nspecial exception, the source code distributed need not include\nanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\nform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\noperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\nitself accompanies the executable.  If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\naccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\naccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as\ndistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.    You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\nexcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\notherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\nvoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\nHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\nthis License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\nparties remain in full compliance.    You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Program or works based on it.    Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\nthese terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\nthis License.    If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.    If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.  It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.  This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.    If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\nthose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.    The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.    Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\nlater version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\neither of that version or of any later version published by the Free\nSoftware Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\nthis License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\nFoundation.    If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\nto ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\nSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\nmake exceptions for this.
